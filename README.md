# simple-shell-java

A very simple implementation of a Linux terminal shell written in Java. Currently, it includes the following commands: `echo`, `type`, `pwd`, `cd`, and `ls`.

## Future updates

The goal is to implement all basic operations, at least the ones I use on a daily basis.

## Errors and problems

This is a learning project, so any tips, suggestions, or ideas are more than welcome!
If you read through the code and spot anything weird or broken, feel free to reach out and let me know!

## About

This project started as one of the Codecrafters challenges. After the free trial ended, I decided to continue it on my own.

# simple-shell-java

A very simple implementation of a Linux terminal shell written in Java. Currently, it includes the following commands: `echo`, `type`, `pwd`, `cd`, and `ls`.

## Future updates

The goal is to implement all basic operations, at least the ones I use on a daily basis.

## Errors and problems

This is a learning project, so any help or suggestions are more than welcome!
If, for some reason, you read through all the code and find any issues, feel free to share your feedback!
